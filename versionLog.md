I decided to enter a field called "series_title", for the sake of multititled series.

I could create a different table for "series_title" but... unless you're a publisher, I don't think you'll have so many series that you'll need a different table to separate them. Actually, I see it more like a first_name/last_name kind of thing.

I am also fixing a few names here and there.
