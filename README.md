### Book series content database
Hi! This is part of my final project for the database fundamentals course of platzi.com

I'm writing a book, so I wanted to create a database that would allow me to store the worldbuilding I made for my story. one that could help me visualize information from a global view, and that could perhaps one day be the foundation of a website's back-end.

I made it so that others can use it too. But keep in mind that this is my first project, so there'll be a lot of room for improvements.

I'll be sure to update according to my experience with the website. But I'll keep the data out of git for now.

####Files
You'll find a *.drawio* file where I built the database, and a *.sql* file with the DDL language for creating the database.

There is also a folder with the entity-relation diagram in a *.jpg* file.
