### Book series content database
Alright! I'm halfway through platzi's Database Fundamentals course, and it's time I start making my own database!

The goal of this project is to create a database to store the worldbuilding of my Hurdles for new guardians book series.

I also wish to create something that'll work for future book series too. And I hope it helps other writers who also wish to manage content for their websites.

Though, of course, the sensitive content of my worldbuilding will not live on github. This is currently just for practice, so I plan on using just enough content at first. (Though I could later include more after the official publish date).

Note: This is my first DevProject. I am fairly new to git, SQL and such. So I'm open to advice :)
