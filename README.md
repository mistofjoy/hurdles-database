### Book series content database
Alright! I'm halfway through platzi's Database Fundamentals course, and it's time I start making my own database!

The goal of this project is to create a database to store the worldbuilding of my Hurdles for new guardians book series.

I'll use this database to manage content, relationships and articles that I will later publish on a website for fans to read (though it will not include the actual book).

I plan to update it according to my evolution as a writer and developer. But I'll leave an updated blank design for github.

I wish to make it so that it'll work for future book series too. And I hope it helps other writers who also wish to manage content for their websites :)

Note: This is my first DevProject. I'm just starting to learn Git and SQL soâ€¦ please undestand if it looks too basic :b
